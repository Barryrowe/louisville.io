Software to generate a consolidated directory and calendar of technology user groups and meetups.

This generates a static site, so the generation is meant to be run as a cron job to keep the site up-to-date. The site is built with the [unfold](https://github.com/ericlathrop/unfold) static site generator.

To generate the site:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run build`
